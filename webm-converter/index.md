# WebMConverter


WebM for Lazys 
=============
A wrapper around ffmpeg and AviSynth made for converting videos to WebM without having to use the command line and Gfycat integration.<!--more--> [Original project](https://gitgud.io/nixx/WebMConverter#webm-for-retards-).

- **Download it [here][LatestDownload].**

Important to know:
* Requires .NET Framework 4.5 (Windows 7 comes with 3.5, so you might want to [update][DotNet45])
* Requires [AviSynth][AviSynth] (2.6.0, 32-bit)
* Already includes ffmpeg
* Only works on Windows (I assume Linux users don't need GUIs)

### Changelog
